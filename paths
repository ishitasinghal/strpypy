Problem Statement

The task is to count all the possible paths from top left to bottom 
right of a mXn matrix with the constraints that from each cell you 
can either move only to right or down.

Input: 

First line consists of T test cases. First line of every test case 
consists of N and M, denoting the number of rows and number of column 
respectively.

Output: 

Single line output i.e count of all the possible paths from top left 
to bottom right of a mXn matrix. Since output can be very large number 
use %10^9+7.
